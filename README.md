                    #JAVASCRIPT VARIABLES#

            A variable is a container that stores a value. This is very similar to the container used to store rice, water and oats (Treats this as an analogy)

            A variable is simply a name of storage location.

        @Rules for declaring variable :-

            1. Name must be start with a letter (a to z) or (A to Z), underscore (_) or dolor ($) sign.

            2. After first letter we can use digits (0 to 9) for example, value 1.

            3. Javascript variable are case sensitive.

        @ Two types of variable

            (1). Local Variable :-
                    A javascript local variable is declared inside block or function. It is accessible within the function or block only.

            (2). Global variable :-
                    A javascript global variable is accessible from any function. A variable i.e. declare outside the function or declared with window object is know as global variable.

        @ VAR :-
                The var statement declares a variable. The classic way, but it's function scope can lead to tricky bugs--use with care.

        @LET :-
                Let is a keyword that is used to declare a block scoped variables. The var keyword is used to declare a variable in javascript. Which is treated as a normal variable but the variable declared using the let keyword are block-scoped.

        @CONST :-
                Ecmascript 6 introduce the const keyword which is used to define a new variable in Javascript.


                    #JAVASCRIPT COMMENTS#


            The javascript comments are meaningful way to deliver message. It is used to add information about the code warning or suggestion so that end user easily understand the code.

            The javascript comments is ignored by the javascript engine.

        @Advantages :-
            (1). To make code easy to understand.
            (2). To avoide the unneccessary code.

        @Type of comments :-
